> Master code through battle. Learn, compete, and level up with your guild.

Built for the **Amazon Nova AI Hackathon 2026**.

## 🎮 What is Codence?

Codence is a multiplayer RPG-styled, pixel-art themed web app that makes learning code actually fun.

Students often glance at code, think they understand it, and move on — only to forget everything later. Codence fixes that by making them *do something* with the code rather than just read it.

### How it works:
1. 🏰 Players create or join a private **Guild** (room) with friends
2. 📜 A player submits a code file — any language
3. 🧠 **Amazon Nova AI** explains it statement by statement with text, visuals, and voice
4. ⚔️ The game begins — lines of code **vanish** and a timer starts
5. ✍️ Players race to fill in the missing lines from memory
6. 🧩 **Quiz rounds** test deeper understanding of the code
7. 🏆 Points and leaderboard keep it competitive — within your guild only

## 🧠 AI Code Explanation

Codence uses **Amazon Nova AI via AWS Bedrock** to explain code before gameplay begins.

When a user submits code:

1. The backend sends the code to **Amazon Nova Pro**.
2. Nova Pro generates a **statement-by-statement explanation** of the code.
3. The explanation is sent to **Amazon Nova Sonic** to generate **voice narration**.
4. The backend returns both **text explanation and audio narration** to the frontend.

### API Endpoint

POST /explain-code

Request:
{
  "code": "def add(a,b): return a+b"
}

Response:
{
  "explanation": "Step-by-step explanation of the code",
  "audio_base64": "generated audio narration"
}

## 🤖 Nova AI Integration

| Model | Role in Codence |
|---|---|
| **Nova Pro** | Analyzes submitted code, generates statement-by-statement explanation and quiz questions |
| **Nova Sonic** | Converts explanation to voice narration played during the explanation phase |
| **Nova Lite** | Evaluates player fill-in-the-blank answers and generates quiz options |
