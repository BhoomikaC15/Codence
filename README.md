# Codence 🧙‍♂️
A multiplayer code learning game powered by Amazon Nova AI.

Built for the Amazon Nova AI Hackathon 2026.

## What it does
Players submit a code file, Nova AI explains it statement by statement 
with text, visuals and voice. Then the game begins — lines of code vanish 
and players race to fill them back in from memory. Quiz rounds test 
understanding. Points and leaderboards keep it competitive.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Monaco Editor
- Backend: FastAPI, Python, Socket.io
- AI: Amazon Bedrock — Nova Pro, Nova Sonic, Nova Lite
